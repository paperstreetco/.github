#### About Us

We are a volunteer organization that seeks to improve the outcome of system administrators and developers by teaching DevOps best practices. This is a group repository for practicing programming and using git version control methods. 


##### Our Background

Our members are very diverse and work on everything from monolitic platforms to HPC and cloud environments. This includes microservices. The goal with this org is to share knowledge across platforms and give our members an opportunity to share skills and create projects. 


#### Warning

This is the project repository for a group of developers to contribute and discuss code. All projects are expirmental and should not be deployed in a production environment without further review.
